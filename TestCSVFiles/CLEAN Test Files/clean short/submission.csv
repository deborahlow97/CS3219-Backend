hemileia vastatrix",reject,yes,yes,"More than two billion cups of coffee are consumed worldwide each day [14]. The livelihood of 120 million people depends on the coffee supply chain [33]. Coffee rust leads to production losses of over $500 million worldwide and may affect futures prices [15]. Coffee rust is caused by the coffee berry borer, or Hemileia vastatrix fungus, at temperatures from 10-30 C, and is one of the main diseases that attacks the coffee arábica plant [19]. Coffee is the second largest traded commodity worldwide, with about $100 billion in volume traded annually [32, 4]. Understanding the relationship between coffee rust, production quantities and futures prices is important to anyone affected by the coffee supply chain. This research offers a new quantitative approach for describing and visualizing the relationship between coffee rust, amount of coffee produced and futures prices."

influential citations",reject,yes,yes,"Information retrieval systems for scholarly literature rely heavily not only on text matching but on semantic and context-based features. Readers nowadays are most interested in how important an article is, its purpose and how influential it is for follow-up research work? Numerous techniques that tap the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence have been developed to improve the retrieval of the most influential scientific literature. We compare and improve on four existing state-of-the-art techniques designed to identify influential citations. Our approach supports information retrieval algorithms that detect and fetch scientific articles on the basis of both qualitative and quantitative indices in scholarly big data. We consider 450 citations from the corpus of 20,527 papers available from the Association for Computational Linguistics, classified by experts as either important or unimportant, and extract 64 features based on the methodology of four state-of-the-art techniques. We apply the Extra Trees classifier to select 29 best features and apply Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to all techniques. We find that our supervised classification model improves on the state-of-the-art by 11.25%, with 89% Precision Recall Curve using the Random Forest Classifier. Finally, we present our deep learning model, the Long Short-Term Memory network, that uses all 64 features to distinguish important and unimportant citations with 92.57% accuracy."

Project management",reject,yes,yes,"This paper analyzes challenges to deploying cloud services in different types of libraries and proposes a set of precautions libraries need to take when planning, deploying, and maintaining cloud services. We apply grounded theory principles to analyze 75 articles authored by library administrators, librarians with IT expertise, IT professionals, cybersecurity experts, and business consultants engaged in planning, deploying, and maintaining cloud services in libraries. Data analysis reveals that a majority of the past literature reports challenges to implementing Software a Service (SaaS) in libraries. The seven key areas critical to the successful implementation of SaaS in libraries are related to: (1) data, (2) authentication and privacy of patrons, (3) skills and knowledge of library staff and organizational culture, (4) IT infrastructure, (5) features of cloud services, (6) fixed and operational costs associated with data and technology, and (7) policies and contracts. Data issues like access, storage, ownership, curation, security, confidentiality, loss, migration, and redundancy seem to have the most influence on SaaS deployment in libraries. Based on project management principles, we make seven recommendations to manage the challenges identified in this study. Libraries can learn and benefit from study findings in terms of reducing their reliance on external IT consultants and managing their scarce resources for better serving patrons."

archiving",accept,yes,yes,"Social networks like Twitter and Facebook are the largest sources of public opinion and real-time information on the Internet.  If an event is of general interest, news articles follow and eventually a Wikipedia page. We propose the problem of automatic event story  generation by combining  social and news data to construct a new type of document in the form of a Wiki-like page structure. We introduce  a technique that shows the evolution of a story as perceived by the crowd in social media, along with editorially authored articles annotated with examples of social media as supporting evidence. At the core of our research, is  the temporally sensitive extraction of data that serve as context for retrieval purposes.
Our approach includes a fine-grained vote counting strategy that is used for weighting purposes,  pseudo relevance feedback and query expansion with social data and web query logs along with a timeline algorithm as the base for a 
story.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by processing a dataset comprising millions of English language tweets generated over a one year period and present a full implementation of our system.

We present a multi-disciplinary methodological framework that was developed to create the Digital Library North for Inuit communities in Canada’s north. The framework adopts a holistic approach, taking into account existing physical and digital collections, information search behaviour of community members, culturally appropriate metadata, user interface design, usability evaluation and sustainability. The methodological framework provides an empirically-supported model for developing community-focused digital libraries and archives that focus on cultural heritage preservation and access."

Based on a novel document indexing processing scheme which combines the use of the Zipf law and the use of bag of patterns, our approach extends the Bag of Words model to represent the knowledge by visual features through relevance feedback. Then annotation propagation is automatically performed to propagate knowledge to the lettrines database. Our approach is presented together with preliminary experimental results and an illustrative example."

explanation harvesting",accept,yes,yes,"Street names are not only used across the world as part of addresses, but also reveal a lot about a country’s identity. Thus, they are subject to analysis in the fields of geography and social science. There, typically, a manual analysis limited to a small region is performed, e.g., focusing on the renaming of streets in a city after a political change in a country. Surprisingly, there have been hardly any automatic, large-scale studies of street names so far, although this might lead to interesting insights regarding the distribution of particular street name phenomena.
In this paper, we present an automated, world-wide analysis of a specific type of street names: street names with date references. Such temporal streets are frequently used to commemorate important events and thus particularly interesting to study. After applying a multilingual temporal tagger to discover such street names, we analyze their temporal and geographic distributions on different levels of granularity. Furthermore, we present an approach to automatically harvest potential explanations why streets in specific regions refer to particular dates. Despite the challenges of the tasks, our evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of both, the temporal street extraction and the explanation harvesting approaches."

N-grams
Word embedding models",reject,yes,yes,"Word embeddings are powerful tools that facilitate better search and data analysis on large-scale digital libraries. They consider the semantics of words extracted from an arbitrary text corpus, such as the Wikipedia dump. Embedding models reflect how the respective language is used in the training corpus. To this end, various approaches use the Google n-gram corpus. It is the largest currently available corpus (with historic data) on the web and exists for several languages. Hence, it is one of the most important publicly available textual digital library on the web. n-gram corpora are an aggregated representation which can even be published if the underlying full text is subject to copyright protection. 
However, n-gram corpora only offer a small window into the full text -- 5 words for the Google corpus at best. This gives way to the concern whether the extracted word semantics are of high quality. The question we study is which quality differences compared to word embedding models computed on full-text corpora one can expect. We answer this question by means of systematic experiments. Our findings confirm that one generally can expect high quality for n-grams with n > 2 and a corpus size dependent value of the minimum count parameter. We also make all models trained with different parameter combinations publicly available on our website; this currently is one of the largest collection of embedding models openly accessible."

Statistical classifier",reject,yes,yes,"Reliable researcher affiliation data is necessary to allow enquiring about international research group productivity and publication patterns. Public bibliographic databases such as DBLP and Google Scholar hold invaluable data about the academic environment. However, the researcher affiliation information is frequently missing or outdated. We propose a statistical data extraction method to
acquire affiliation information directly from university websites and solve the name extraction task in general. Previous approaches to web data extraction either lack in flexibility, because wrappers do not generalize well on cross website tasks, or they lack in precision, because domain agnostic methods neglect useful properties of this particular application domain. Our statistical approach solves
the name extraction task with a framework that incorporates both textual and structural features to yield an outstanding tradeoff between generality and precision. We conducted experiments over a collection of 152 faculty web pages in multiple languages from universities in 49 countries and obtained 94.40% precision, 97.61% recall and 0.9597 F-measure at the extraction task."

This paper contributes a method for ontology fusion based on the inspiration of binary metrics (BSOnto), with the aim to reduce the massive similarity calculation both spatially and logically. By introducing the definition of heterogeneous ontology, entities of ontologies, and rules of ontology fusion on the base of concept fusion and relationship fusion, we put forward the algorithm of main traverse procedure. To testify the usability of our proposal, we conduct two experiments with standard ontologies. The experiment with small datasets of ontologies describes that BSOnto has a higher precision and a lower recall than some tools, and the F-measure is approximately above 0.8. The experiment with large dataset affirms the high precision and F-measure, and timeless efficiency. BSOnto will be improved on stability for large data."

Trivial Baseline",accept,yes,yes,"This work addresses the problem of author name homonymy in the Web of Science.
Aiming for an efficient, simple and straightforward solution, we introduce a novel probabilistic similarity measure for author name disambiguation based on feature overlap.
Using the researcher-ID available for a subset of the documents in the Web of Science, we evaluate the application 
of this measure in the context of agglomeratively clustering author mentions.
We focus on a concise evaluation that shows clearly for which problem setups and at which time during the clustering process our approach works best.
In contrast to most other works in this field, we are skeptical towards the performance of author name disambiguation methods in general and compare our approach to the trivial single-cluster baseline.
Our results are presented separately for each correct clustering size as we can explain that, when treating all cases together, the trivial baseline and more sophisticated approaches are hardly distinguishable in terms of evaluation results.
Our model shows state-of-the-art performance for all correct clustering sizes without any discriminative training and with tuning only one convergence parameter."

Distributional Thesaurus Network
Complex Network Measures",reject,yes,yes,"In this era of Big Data, due to expeditious exchange of information on the web, words are being used to denote newer meanings, causing linguistic shift. With the recent availability of large  amounts of  digitized texts, an automated analysis of the evolution of language has become possible. 
Our study mainly focuses on improving the detection of new word senses. This paper presents a unique proposal based on network features to improve the precision of new word sense detection. For a candidate word where a new sense (birth) has been detected by comparing the sense clusters induced at two different time points, we further compare the network properties of the subgraphs induced from novel sense cluster across these two time points. Using the mean fractional change in edge density, structural similarity and average path length as features in an SVM classifier, manual evaluation gives precision values of 0.86 and 0.74 for the task of new sense detection, when tested on 2 distinct time-point pairs, in comparison to the precision values in the range of 0.23-0.32, when the proposed scheme is not used. The outlined method can therefore be used as a new post-hoc step to improve the precision of novel word sense detection in a robust and reliable way where the underlying framework uses a graph structure. Another important observation is that even though our proposal is a post-hoc step, it can be used in isolation and that itself results in a very decent performance achieving a precision of 0.54-0.62. Finally, we show that our method is able to detect the well-known historical shifts in 80% cases."

Knowledge Discovery
Digital Libraries",accept,yes,yes,"Knowledge is defined as facts, information, descriptions or skills acquired through experience or education. Valid, useful knowledge can help people make better predictions, support decision making and improve people’s lives. Knowledge Discovery focuses on searching and extracting useful knowledge from data, databases and documents with different methodologies. The goal of Knowledge Discovery is mainly to uncover hidden relationships between data with techniques from artificial intelligence, mathematics, statistics, and algorithms.  
A digital library stores and organizes a collection of digital objects, such as text, images, videos, sounds. Some of the characteristics that digital library has can make knowledge discovery easier: 1) digital library is an open platform. Users from all over the world can have access to the collection of digital library via internet; 2) digital library is an integration of a variety of information and multimedia services which allows multiple access; 3) digital library can provide fast and efficient access and user friendly interfaces for users to retrieve information; 4) digital library usually is a large, well organized collection that persist over time. It can contain many formats and digital objects that may be otherwise unobtainable. All the above characteristics of digital library will facilitate knowledge extraction, transformation, analyzing and presentation. 
The objectives of the proposed workshop are to explore:
1) Existing and novel techniques to extract and present knowledge from Digital Libraries
2) Advanced ways to organize and maintain Digital Libraries to facilitate Knowledge Discovery
3) Knowledge Discovery applications in Business
4) New challenges and technologies have been brought to the area of knowledge Discovery and Digital Libraries"
