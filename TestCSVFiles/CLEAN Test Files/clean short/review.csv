Also “human centered” seem to be more buzz-words rather than actual requirements or features. 
If this contribution will be accepted, it might be worth to better present and discuss the concept of the library as a “digital octopus”, as this is one aspect of the actual (hot) discussions whether research data should be part of the library or rather part of the “digital laboratory” (i.e. the infrastructure) supporting the research activities.","Overall evaluation: 0

6,4,326,Jacxxxx Saxx,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) The topics of the paper is clearly appropriate for the JCDL conference.  The authors presents a study of the effectiveness of four learning schemes used to predict the quality of a citation (binary:  important vs. marginal) in an corps of scientific papers (ACL corpus on computational linguistics). The experiment is based on a set of 450 citations (not so big).  

In a second part, the authors propose two new learning strategies (one based on SVM and random forest, the second on a deep learning architecture).  The experiment shows that a better performance (precision, Recall, F1) can be achieved by the two new proposed schemes.  A statistical test is missing to confirm this findings.    

minor points
Who are the experts (Page 3, Section 3).
Is the citation collection available? (Page 3, Section 3)
Section 4.1. not fully clear:  ""Each feature is divided into four categories""  Each feature or the whole feature set?
Section ""4 Results ..."" must be ""5. Results ..""
In Fig 2 and 3 :  add a space before ""(area =""
Page 7:  ""by using the-fold"" -> ""by using the three-fold""
""6 Conclusion""  -> ""7. Conclusion""
In the conclusion, the support for your learning scheme is a single collection... maybe another scientific domain can have a different citation pattern..

I provide several suggestions and hope the authors can consider: More sentences should be provided for better elaborating the motivation of this paper.

8,4,421,Bxx Y,3,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) This paper proposed a new classifier for citation purpose classification by consolidating features from four prior models, and also a LSTM model. Overall the paper does not demonstrate significant intellectual contribution for the following reasons:

First, consolidating prior models is incremental work, unless some insights were provided regarding the strength and weakness of each model, and how the new model addresses these issues. Unfortunately no such analysis was provided. 

Second, the use of LSTM model cannot be justified because LSTM takes sequence input, but the 64 features do not form sequence. The parameters like 52 input units do not match with the 64 features. More details are needed to explain the implementation of the LSTM. Because the data set is rather small with only hundreds of examples, a 5-layer LSTM model is likely overfitting.  

Other issues:

The authors did extensive literature review on related work. It would be more helpful if the classification tasks can be specifically described along with performance comparison in that different studies used different numbers of categories and their definitions vary as well.

The research method description could also include more rationale for critical choices. For example, in 3.1. why used three different tools (OpenNLP, StanfordParser and Factorie) for pre-processing? How are features like ""Author uses tools/algorithm of cited article"" extracted?","Overall evaluation: -2

10,4,8,Ghxxxx Abxxxx,4,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) the authors apply the Extra-Trees classifier to extract 29 best new features and create a new model that they use to apply Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to classify reference as important or not important. The new model improves on the state of the art by 11.25 according to the experimental results.
The paper is technically sound, the approach is described in details and the results are reasonable. My understanding is that the paper contributed two things:
1- identified new features that will help with enhancing model accuracy
2- compared different models using two different supervised learning approaches (SVM's and RF)

The related work section is a little long for a technical paper, however, it provided a nice survey of the previous work. I wish it was shorter and the extra space was used to better explain the paper contribution and add more tables such as the confusion matrix which I like to look at since I can get more information about the model performance. 

Using the LSTM was not justified especially since LSTM is not suitable for this kind of data. The only justification given is that it is a new popular approach which is not a good justification.","Overall evaluation: 1

12,5,326,Jacxxxx Saxx,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) Interesting paper.  The authors have analyzed 75 papers on experiments / presentation / descriptions of deploying cloud services for libraries. The main results focus on data, patrons, library staff, IT infrastructure, cloud services, costs, and policies & contracts. Besides these main aspects, the authors underline that the librarians must understand the IT processes.  In addition, the authors mention clearly the problems related to the legal aspects, the risks, and the importance for librarians to support the new web services. 

In a second part, the paper presents seven main recommendations to help librarians in selecting / developing a set of cloud services (the service scope, managing the time, the costs, the quality, the human resource, the communication and the risks).   

The style and writing of the paper is clear and easy to follow.  The organisation is good and examples are used to help the reader to understand the underlying problems / issues / possible solutions.

14,5,411,Zhxxx Xx,2,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) The paper summarizes challenges reported in papers related to library cloud adaptions, then offers some general guidelines to address these challenges. While the topic is relevant and of interest to JCDL audiences, the paper does not go deep enough to reveal much new information not already well known. The methods section lacks details, making it difficult to evaluate the validity of the results. The recommendations section makes all identified challenges a project management issue, which lacks support from the literature and experience. A few other issues:

1. Figure 1 is too small. The clustering and the linking could be a major contribution of the paper but are not sufficiently addressed in the paper.
2. It is not clear how many of the identfied challenges are library specific. It feels like that they are in general limitations of any SaaS. These issues are being addressed by the industry, e.g., via govcloud, better tooled management interfaces, and better cost estimation, etc. It’s not clear if the challenges remain unresolved or have been alleviated by these new developments.
3. Are library journals the best place to mine these challenges? It may be the case that libraries lag behind the IT industry in cloud adoptions such that library SaaS is implemented poorer than industry average and then library personnel is poorer prepared for the transition? Or the quality of some papers can be lacking? For example, the UWHS example cited in the paper drawing from a single failure of adopting free cloud-based videoconferencing its conclusion that ‘UWHS is less likely to rely on any free, cloud application for any “critical project again”’. This clearly ignores the fact that a significant number of universities have already outsourced their email services to free google or Microsoft cloud services.
4. The focus on SaaS, in particular ILS, does not take into considerations of many other library cloud adoptions. Many institutional repository software, including Dspace and fedora, have developed cloud images and are widely used.

15,5,301,Bexx Plxx,3,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) The manuscript addresses the role of cloud computing in library services.  Is there a net gain to incorporating cloud services? What are they? What are the potential problems?   While cloud computing as a formalized concept has been in the lexicon of IT for over a decade, with recent growing awareness of data sensitivities and vulnerabilities, the topic remains timely.  The objective of the manuscript is strong:  illuminate the benefits and concerns to incorporating cloud computing in library services, and offer recommendations.  

The manner in which the objective is achieved is deeply weak however. A fundamental weakness is an ill defined concept of cloud computing.  For instance, the authors imply that email is a cloud service. It is not, and shows confusion over the difference between distributed local area services provided by an institution and commercial cloud providers.  The authors bring some clarity to the question by naming Software As A Service (SAAS) in the abstract, but this is only mentioned in the abstract and the SAAS concept is then not carried through the body of the work.   The manuscript could be improved by carrying the concept of SAAS through the manuscript, and within that, carefully distinguishing local area services (such as those supported by the institution), private cloud services, and public cloud services.   Use a similar conceptual frame to identify library services too - those are similarly not well defined.   

The two major topics of the manuscript: a challenges of cloud computing (Sections 3, 4) and a recommendation section (5). The two topics are disjoint, and appear to have been glued together given that they do not support one another, do not flow from one to the other, and have opposing assumptions.  The challenges (Sections 3, 4) appears to be a student literature survey; it is written in a halting, disconnected style that speaks to a master's student summarizing papers and hooking them together in a barely present narrative.  This incoherence between topics and a glaring lack of technical knowledge on the part of the authors results in rather absurd inferred conclusions (i.e., 4.1 para 3): Since anyone can set up a cloud account, it is advisable to not share patron data over the web.   (4.1 para 7): Data loss is a glaring threat because (Amazon) hosts can crash. The reviewer refrains from attempting to explain why these are absurd conclusions, and instead suggests that the authors can improve the manuscript by vetting the conclusions with someone with deeper technical knowledge than the authors appear to have. 

The authors raise good questions about the location, rights, and protections of their major data assets.   The institution as a stakeholder has data resource management policies that affect the decision to move core data assets to a commercial cloud.  The manuscript would be strengthened by a focus on data assets of the libraries. The reviewer recommends this focus.  

For this or any topic to be effective in the context of this manuscript, however, the challenges need to be crisply identified in a more coherent narrative in Sec 4, and then addressed in an integrated fashion in Sec 5.   This requires bringing together the highly disparate Sec's 4 and 5, but that is required anyway for the manuscript to approach being in a form that contributes to a reader's knowledge.  

In summary, while the manuscript is far too weak for inclusion in this venue, the authors are encouraged to continue to work on the topic especially in handling the data assets of a library. It is recommended that the authors additionally engage a technical data scientist who can help crystallize the true challenges of moving to a commercial cloud.

(CONFIDENTIAL REMARKS FOR THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE) The paper is heavily flawed;  it's two relatively unconnected topics glued together.  The first topic shows glaring weakness of knowledge in computing, resulting in absurd conclusions.  The second topic does not reflect any conclusions from the first topic; it is completely standalone.  I will strongly argue against this manuscript being accepted in the form that it is in.  Perhaps next year we'll see a better version.","Overall evaluation: -3

17,6,2,Trxxx Aaxxxx,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) This short paper presents a mobile device application that supports the exploration of the physical collection in a library building by recommending relevant subject areas in other areas. Log file analysis is used to answer some specific research questions such as what trends can be identified for this kind of browsing.

I find this research is interesting and relevant for the conference, but although the experiment is somewhat easy to understand, the presentation is unfocused and not yet at the level that is required for a conference publication. 

In the abstract and the beginning of the paper, the paper claims to present the development and evaluation of the topic space recommendation model. I do not find that this model is presented properly anywhere in the paper, and do not see any references to other papers presenting it. It is partially described in the background section, but difficult to identify what this model actually does. In the conclusion, the name of the app that implements this module is mentioned but it is unclear if this app module is the same as the model initially indicated as the topic of the paper. 

The introduction of the paper (as well as the abstract) lacks the contextualization and motivation for this experiment. I also find it inappropriate to include authors contention and personal position, as it only weakens the contribution.  In general, the paper lacks a good description with examples on how the system works and what the actual contribution is.

A main contribution of this paper seems to be the log analysis that is used to answer 2 research questions. The first RQ is well formulated, but the second is hard to figure out and the author can improve the contribution from this research by more carefully designing a set of well-defined research questions. 

The graphs do not render well on my print, and I suspect that this also will be a problem in the final print. Even in the pdf on screen, the images do not render well because of low resolution. 

The analysis in the finding seems to be focused on what recommendations that have been made - or followed by end users. Given that the log is covering 2 years, I find the number of users and records recommended surprisingly low and indicates a mobile app that is rather infrequently used? It is somewhat unclear if they at all investigated how successful the recommendations where. Phrases like ""checkout records"" and ""strong enough for circulation"" may make sense for a librarian but is not a precise way of describing the limitations of the research. The recommendations are described as having a ""long tail power law distribution"" but the research would have been much more interesting if the authors succeeded in explaining this phenomena in terms of user experience. All in all, I find it hard to figure out what the actual findings are.

The paper has a good list of publications, although the formatting needs to be improved.","Overall evaluation: -1

19,6,138,Danxxxx Gxx,2,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) In the digital era, the huge number of books gets harder and harder to manage over time. In order to solve this problem, the author of this paper presents a new application in order to develop and evaluate the topic space recommendation model. 
Also, this study presents some interesting results about how this application increases awareness and access to library services. 
The structure of this paper is clear and  well proportioned. Also, the method is presented in detail, giving enough information about the methods used. 
However, a few comments should be taken into account by the author:
- Figure 1 should be placed in the paper near where it is first discussed, rather than at the end of the Introduction, if possible.
- Proofreading is necessary to correct some minor errors (pg. 1 “to scholarly inquiry”, “has been renewed interest on” – the use of the article is recommended; “a collections”).
The paper describe how to develop and evaluate the topic space recommendation model as an alternative to the personalization algorithm. Anyway, in order to develop this model by using a mobile application, this research has a good practical implication.
With suggested minor improvements along these lines, this paper can make a good case for digital library development.","Overall evaluation: 2

20,6,427,Zhxxxx Zhxx,3,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) This paper did an analysis of how library users navigate different categories of books by using a mobile app. To be more specific, the authors analyzed the log of 18 unique mobile app users over 2 years, and analyzed how's the recommendation quality after users have scanned some book barcodes. The conclusions are that: (1) some book classes have more subsequent recommendations than others. (2) the outlier analysis shows how topic expansions are related with some attributes, and resulted in long-tail phenomenon. 

My general feeling about this paper is borderline. One major issue that I'm concerned most is that there are too few users involved in this study (i.e. only 18 unique users). This might cause high variance in the subsequent analysis. Moreover, I strongly suggest the authors combine more closely Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 to show how the log analysis of the apps and Fig.2&3 lead to the conclusions in Sec.5. In its current writing, my feeling is that Sec.5 is very loosely connected with Sec.4. 

My past experience on Internet-related analysis papers is that, a study like this shall be done on at least hundreds of users, and use statistics or data analysis tools to reveal some key metrics (e.g. number of expanded topics after starting item, the plot of long-tail distribution, some more quantitative analysis) which lead to the claimed conclusions. But I do acknowledge this may not apply to library science, and it's possibly wrong in this paper's case, so please use your discretion to ignore this paragraph.","Overall evaluation: 0
