hemileia vastatrix",reject,yes,yes,"More than two billion cups of coffee are consumed worldwide each day [14]. The livelihood of 120 million people depends on the coffee supply chain [33]. Coffee rust leads to production losses of over $500 million worldwide and may affect futures prices [15]. Coffee rust is caused by the coffee berry borer, or Hemileia vastatrix fungus, at temperatures from 10-30 C, and is one of the main diseases that attacks the coffee ar√°bica plant [19]. Coffee is the second largest traded commodity worldwide, with about $100 billion in volume traded annually [32, 4]. Understanding the relationship between coffee rust, production quantities and futures prices is important to anyone affected by the coffee supply chain. This research offers a new quantitative approach for describing and visualizing the relationship between coffee rust, amount of coffee produced and futures prices."
