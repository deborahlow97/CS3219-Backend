2,2,63,Vitxxxx Casxxxx,2,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) The topic is interesting, and undoubtedly touches upon very important economic aspects of the world-wide coffee trade. However, I believe that it would be of interest to a (very) small group of JCDL attendees. I would suggest to present this topic to a more appropriate event.","Overall evaluation: -1

3,3,48,Juxxxx Bruxxxx,1,"(OVERALL EVALUATION) This poster analyzes responses from town hall-style meetings regarding smart communities and the implications for digital libraries. I found the methods to be confusing; the author appears to have listened to meetings and derived the opinions of the participants in the meetings and the associated implications on digital libraries in smart communities. Coupled with the double blind submission, the poorly defined methods and results leave enough doubt to prevent this from being accepted.","Overall evaluation: -1
