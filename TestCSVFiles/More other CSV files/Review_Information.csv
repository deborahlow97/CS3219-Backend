Thank you for answering my questions in detail. I understand that you assured the generality of the heuristics by introducing “token types.” It would be helpful to define the terms used in your paper in an early part with illustrative examples, like showing a sentence with time expressions and marking them with token types, modifiers, etc. That would help readers to understand what exactly these terms represent.

I would prefer discussions in these answers summarized in a paragraph in a paper to clarify the generality of your method.",

The first few times I read this paper, I thought you were leaning embeddings for morphemes and adding them to the bare word, which is exactly what Botha & Blunsom did.",

Now it
is more clear how you incorporate morphemes in the embedding space. However, I
think the paper lacks clarity and I am not sure whether using the morpheme
meanings in the embedding space is a major contribution to be published as a
long paper in this conference, besides all the recent deep learning papers that also incorporate morphological information.

NOTE ADDED BY AC: Some other relevant prior work includes
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1156
and
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1047 .

NOTE ADDED BY AC: The methods in section 3.2 and 3.3 seem oddly hacky, because of the pipeline architecture where you train separate embeddings and then try to figure out which morphemes contribute most to the word and then use this to pick new embeddings.  Instead, why not jointly fit all the embeddings and the contribution weights?  In doing this, you could use a prior on the contribution weights, to express a preference for having all morphemes contribute significantly to the word.",

I understand how space limitations might affect why not all results can be presented and all model directions explored.

Regarding the number of incoming dependency edges, it is true that it is a weighted sum but there is no average/max pooling which is why I raised the question. Given the results, I guess it doesn't affect results much but it would still be good to address it briefly (if possible).

The authors' mention that the use of the tensor means their model without dependency bridges does as well as the JRNN. However, I'm still unclear on how it would affect trigger identification + classification (I can understand if the performance is higher for arguments). This means that the decoding portion needs to be explained in more detail (i.e. the argument scores affect the trigger detection in some fashion through some joint decoding).

I believe that this is a good paper but I feel that due to the confusion about the model, experiments and unclear writing, it still needs some work.",

The 'DN' of the pipeline framework to perform BWE, DAN and DN sequentially means domain-adaptation adversarial network proposed by others. As the authors proposed a joint network to combine these three existing components for cross-lingual sentiment analysis. It is necessary to test weather a straight-forward way (pipeline based) can perform good enough.

The authors do not convince me about the technical novelty of the proposed method (no response in the rebuttal). In addition, the issue on the suggested transfer learning baseline, cross-lingual SCL is not addressed. Moreover, this is actually a semi-supervised learning setting where some labeled data in the target domain is available. In this case, there are many other semi-supervised cross-lingual baseline methods needed to be mentioned in related work, or implemented for comparison. 

Overall, the proposed idea looks promising for cross-lingual sentiment analysis. However, it is not ready to be published at ACL yet.",

I have read the authors' response. Unfortunately, I am not convinced that the quality of the paper will be significantly improved. Methods are complex and should be well explained. Authors mention several times that the space limitation is a problem, which implies that maybe they should submit two separate papers.",

2) Why use max in Equation (3) instead of other aggregation functions ?

3) Some notations are abused. For example, r is used in two parts (Page 4, Page 5), representing two different concepts. 

4) In Section 3.5 Alignment Selection, why use ""sim(w1, w2) <= 0.5"" as the selection criterion ? Intuitively, the valid matching should have higher similarity score (smaller distance). 

5) For the empirical evaluation, the proposed approach is to target many-to-many matching while some comparison approaches are not. How does the author addresses that to make fair comparisons is not clear to me.",

I am wondering how much benefits can be obtained by just employing horizontal connections? It is the case when comparing DeepLAU to DeepGRU on the setting (1,1).

2, Residential and fast forward connections can accommodate more deep layers (tens of layers) and performance can also be improved using deeper structures. I see that 8 layers is just comparable to 4 layer for DeepLAU. I am very curious when DeepLAU is applying more than 10 layers. If DeepLAU cannot benefit from even deeper structures, maybe it is not the best for deep networks for NMT.

3, The authors did not provide any statistics about the time complexity and training time of the proposed models compared to other systems. What is the case when the depth grows? What is the case comparing different structures using the same depth?

4, How to calculate H(x_t)? Does it influence the final results if using different ways?",

Automatic reordering seems to do better as intuitively it can reorder any types of phrases that need to be reordered. If the LRMs are not enough to reorder accurately, the authors can also explain why, or most ideally show experimental results that, prior pre-ordering methods cannot accurately pre-order Chinese to Vietnamese-ordered Chinese.",

However, the more important contribution in this paper is the sentence transformation/expansion rules because they are the keys to scaling the constructed sentences up to a useful evaluation set. Therefore, it is important to report the statistics on initial correction made by the leader judges. If the error rate of the expansion step is not horrible and makes the proposed procedure become very expensive to run, I would consider to adjust my review to a higher score.",

First, the contributions of the paper are not clearly explained. It could be that the contribution is that they *compare* different approaches over the same data and the same DA classification. Differently, previous work use different data and different DA classifications and hence it is more difficult to objectively compare the different approaches. However, I am not sure whether this is the case. I am just suggesting this as a sample objective argument.  
  
Second, the description of related work is vague and unsatisfying (see my review for details). 

If the authors are able to clarify these two points convincingly, I would consider revising my review.",

Response to the Rebuttal:
The authors write ""The paper aims to model dynamics of tweets and users involved in rumour stories by integrating Twitter features into point process framework. More experimental results on Ferguson data demonstrating this are available in the supplementary material and will be included in the revised paper.""  Modeling isn't really a goal in and of itself, it is something one does to achieve the goal.  So what is the goal?  The authors seem to have missed the point of comment.",

I guess something is lost in translation here. I don't understand ""each hypothesis is specific to a question, so they cannot share formulas directly."" Probably, the authors should have presented more concrete examples and consistent definitions. 

Also, I'm still puzzled on the definition of Q(H,T) since in P.4,"" H and T are entity sets in the question and the option of answer, respectively"" while in Figure 1, x and z look like variables, not entity sets, in Q(x,z). Such inconsistency makes it difficult to understand the discussion precisely.",

I can also imagine that HashNet is very difficult to implement in existing frameworks (e.g., torch, theano, tensorflow); even if successfully implemented, it will either (1) be *very* slow or (2) cache the indexes, thus saving actually *no* space. So I am not concerned with efficiency improvement.

However, it will still be nice to see if sub-vector sharing benefits, hurts, or makes no difference in terms of PPL, compared with ""random weight sharing"" as in HashNet. The authors instead show sub-vector sharing improves, or at least does not hurt, performance compared with other compression method (including LightRNN) and non-compression methods. So I now believe the experiments are reasonably convincing, provided that HashNet is itself very difficult to implement. In this sense, I raised my score to 3.

It's still unclear why 44M dataset yields a validation PPL which is almost half of test PPL?",

In many cases, there is more than one type of connectives occurred, triggering different types of relations. For example, in the sentence “since Arg1, meanwhile Arg2”, the connective “since” may trigger a causal relation or temporal, and “meanwhile” triggers temporal relation. Could you let me know what relation is held between the arguments when you remove one or both the connectives? Did the selective attention memory model definitely percepts the genuine relation between them? What attention will be focused on by the model for the possible temporal relation and what for causal? I suggest that the insignificant performance achieved by that complex model is probably caused by less consideration taken into the solution of the underlying problems, such as kinds of explicit relation disambiguation. After all, the additional resources (instances of explicit relations) are added to the training data or used to provide pseudo ground-truth data for learning. It is natural for a recognizer to figure out the correspondence between connectives and relations in practice, especially when it will do so for large-scale data, e.g., the instances in Gigaword.",

- The approach requires a number of hand-coded rules.
- I wonder how these enhancements can be easily generalized from the question answering domain to general semantic parsing. My request was to change the paper's title to something like ""universal semantic parsing for question answering"" or ""semantic parsing with universal dependencies"", unless the approach can be claimed to work competitively on general text. No answer. Having a paper called ""universal semantic parsing"" is quite a bold statement unless you can defend it.
- I was asking the authors to put the approach in context and compare it with alternative work. 
- It is not clear why they performed training differently in Tables 3 and 4.",

My main concern --the pretense that syntax dependency roles subj and dobj are one-to-one with semantic roles agent and patient-- is simply ignored.

The example in figure 7(a) corresponds to the pseudo inter-word dependencies from Zhang et al(2014).
 Note Zhang et al(2014) also proposes real inter-word dependencies where character dependencies are linguistically motivated and manually annotated.  The difference here is that this work uses char-dependences from SCDT.  In addition, Zhang et al(2014) does not use character position to further distinguish character POS.  In this work, char level POS also largely benefits from SCDT.  

""Table 2 directly compares different character tagging strategies, including two previous strategies which are implemented in our adopted Treebank, thus the results are strictly comparable and fully proved that the linguistics-motivated character-level structure that we consider is also computationally more helpful than previous work.""

Table is a comparison of parsing performance on characters.  Since this work uses character dependencies from SCDT and previous work (e.g., Zhang et al(2014)) uses their own char-dependency annotation, I still do not think the numbers are directly comparable.",

Thank you for answering my questions. Evaluation regarding defect sentences as a set is desired to show if your method achieves the goal of (1), rather than recall. For example, in the example of Figure 1, the recall value is the same when your method identifies sentence 2 and 6 and does so for sentence 5 and 6. Given your claims in the paper, the latter case should be regarded as better than the former since it preserves the context of a defect. 

As for Figure 2, it ""adds"" partially annotated data to the fully annotated training set. I'd like to see the performance of your method trained using only the partially annotated data.",

Is it because MOOC material are mostly short sentences and NMT performs better generating short translations (reason why they observed more omission errors for NMT for 2 over 4 languages)?
Is it because NMT generates more human-like and informative translations?",

This paper should have a 3.5 score for the ""RECOMMENDATION"" as discussed in the reviewers' forum and also after the author's rebuttal and clarification of the points.


Should the paper be accepted or rejected? 
===

3.5 = I learned some nuggets of knowledge from this paper and would like to see it accepted.

Possibly it'll be helpful/useful to see the messages on the reviewers' message board for this paper. 
Below would be my annonymized post to the fellow reviewers on the message board:

Dear R1 and R2,

R1 is right about hyperparameter sweep being non-independent of each other. I've mentioned it in my review too. Also, manual evaluation on a sample of the test set or significant values would be really good addition to the paper. I believe the significant values can be easily appended to the paper.

There are still many variables to consider but all that cannot be put together in a conference paper, it would have to be an journal publication or a very detailed documentation manual.

Actually, if the author toned down their claims and call it an ""hyperparameter ablation study"" instead of ""massive exploration"" and from ""novel work"" to ""meticulous work"", I think it's a paper that's great to have in the MT community.

Nevertheless, I think we need more of these work that share a standard benchmark script and look into the effects of the individual hyperparameters. The ""attention"" experiments are somewhat novel, although there are unpublished work that has similar line of thoughts.

Previously, from the Moses PB- / Syntax-based MT, there're also many blackbox effects. And given the NMT paradigm, it's a fresh start and I think it'll be good to set a good example for future papers to look at the hyperparameters ablation more seriously.

Regards,
R3",

The paper would be much stronger if the model is also evaluated on another task such as MT since the claim that the latent variable would capture the grammatical structure of the output should apply to translations too.

This leads me to downgrade my rating from 4 to 3.",

Lines 082-099 suggest that the motivation is machine translation, i.e. probabilistic relation between strings and graphs and back.  I did not get any sign that the author can relate this work to (1) probabilistic parsing from strings into AMR graphs or (2) reranking top AMR-parses produced by some parser that can do this.  As a result, the motivation of the work is unclear to me.  It is extremely uninteresting to say that regular languages are obtained if the grammar is as simple as in Fig 5: Instead, we need yields of graphs, and string languages from which to map, probabilistically, to graphs.   But the probability model is not discussed with an appropriate detail.  

I expected to talk about some noncrossing trees over strings when the yield is restricted to strings like CFGs can be intersected with an FSA.  Instead, the authors say that ""RGGs are similar to right-linear or left-linear grammars"".  Either the author did not understand what is my problem or the formalism is not giving anything new beyond right/left linear grammars.    

After the reply, I am no more so sure if the final paper will be so motivated and clear as I first hoped.  This affects the score.",

- Consideration of authors' response

The authors' response convinced me that hyper-parameter optimization was adequate. I've changed my overall score to reflect that.

1) Applications or scientific/linguistic findings.
The authors should specify the position of this paper whether this is toward some applications in low-resource situations or scientific/linguistic findings. And then, the authors should discuss more about how much the analytical results in the paper contribute to that.

2) ASR with the other language
I understand that the transcriptions (by ASR) are only used for the evaluation. However, this means that we cannot evaluate this technique or provide some analysis with low-resource languages, which does not have an ASR system. The authors should discuss how these analyses/evaluations are used for low-resource languages.

3) Comparison
This paper lacks the comparison for the analytical results, and I strongly recommend the authors to provide some comparisons. Any aspects are fine (e.g., using shallow networks or existing word discovery techniques with limited audio data, and showing that how any of Figure 1-3 and Table 2-4 would change)

4) page 4 'The model we use in this paper is compared against the meanpool variant of the model architecture presented in Harwath et al. (2016).'
This must be clarified more. What kinds of the meanpool variant is used in Harwath et al. (2016)?",

1) address the issue of inter-annotator agreement, preferably including statistics for the data set as a whole.
2) clarify the characteristics of the training and development sets -- are there no overlapping entities between these sets too? 
3) clarify the task definition: what is the set of options from which the systems make predictions in each setting?

- I am slightly worried that orthogonality is too radical or drastic a solution to the repeated words problem. Have the authors investigated some kind of trade-off in which orthogonality is a soft constraint whose weighting should be learned in order to balance diversity and the original training criterion?

- The proposed method achieves much higher ROUGE scores compared to the baselines. It would be nice to better understand what the model is doing. One possibility which might be problematic is that the diversity attention mechanism allows the model to ignore grammaticality concerns and skip function words, in order to cram more content words and phrases which improve ROUGE scores. 

- On a related evaluation note, it would be nice to see another baseline system which is like the D2 model, but without the constraint of equation (12). This would let us understand the impact of adding another LSTM layer for the context vectors on performance, as opposed to the orthogonality constraint.",

1. Can you motivate or justify comparing to the realization results of PBMT (Pourdamghani et al., 2016) trained on a different, smaller dataset?
2. Can you verify that there is no test-set contamination introduced indirectly via use of Gigaword?


After reading the 'Author Response to Reviewers':

The authors addressed the questions I had regarding the results of PBMT and the use of Gigaword. Provided that the field is interested in the AMR formalism, the paper/research seems relatively well constructed. As future work (beyond the scope of this paper): As more sentences get annotated with AMR, it would be useful to begin to investigate whether sequence-to-sequence models on a particular task (e.g., MT) are already recovering the signal encoded in the AMR. (In other words, it would be helpful to pin down the added benefit (if any) of the hand-coded AMRs, as opposed to learning a sequence-to-sequence model, for example, directly. An analogous question emerges for the question of directly incorporating syntax into such models.)",

This is a major flaw. I would like the authors to explain how they plan to make the paper accessible to a bigger part of the ACL community -- but frankly I'm not sure this can be accepted without a 2nd reviewing round, since it implies a major rewrite. 2) In the introduction, authors only say ""we frame knowledge acquisition as joint inference over two closely related puzzles: inferring relative physical knowledge about object pairs while simultaneously reasoning about physical implications of actions"". There are many different ways one could do this. The introduction (or some other section early on) should summarize the approach, without technicalities. I would appreciate it if authors provided this summary in their response.

Regarding the second experiment: I would like authors to explain why they didn't apply model B in the second experiment, and what they can say about their model not improving over the baseline in this experiment (I'm referring to test set results, of course). I would also like them to give more details about the baseline and explain why it is an adequate baseline.",
